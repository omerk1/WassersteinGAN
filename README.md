2. discriminator.py- defining the discriminator architecture. model_type='DCGAN' defines a regular gan discriminator, and model_type='WGAN' defines a WGAN critic.
3. gan.py- defines the whole training procedure of regular GAN.
4. wgan.py- defines the whole training procedure of WGAN.
5. data_loading.py- loads MNIST dataset and filter it.
